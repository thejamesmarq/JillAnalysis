Which one,0,Jill,2018-08-26 00:13:43
Parking or main,0,Jill,2018-08-26 00:13:46
Parking is closer to that corner,0,James,2018-08-26 00:14:04

"Haven't gone to any bachata classes though, just an observation",0,Jill,2018-08-27 16:37:08
I have got a small down there,0,Jill,2018-08-26 16:30:34
Thank god I can say that about myself!!,0,Jill,2018-08-26 16:30:58
Yup. World is better for it,0,James,2018-08-26 20:57:32
"Last night you were in my room, and now my bed sheets smell like you.",0,James,2018-08-26 22:18:14
But not for very long because I‚Äôm doing laundry.,0,James,2018-08-26 22:18:24
Lyrics that didn‚Äôt make it into the song,0,James,2018-08-26 22:18:36

"I had the ""perfect"" version you sang next to ear the whole day! I think I like it!",0,Jill,2018-08-26 22:33:16
Any time you want to duet I‚Äôm game üòâ,0,James,2018-08-26 22:37:36
Unintended double entendre! But I feel nice knowing the song stuck around!,0,James,2018-08-26 22:41:21
A lot more stuck around üòÅ,0,Jill,2018-08-26 22:43:20
"Very intentional triple entender, if you count both hair and liquid ",0,Jill,2018-08-26 22:44:35
 Quadruple actually ,0,Jill,2018-08-26 22:45:26
"The thing you said about sheeran being one of the few who puts his heart on his sleeve and is ok with being vulnerable, you're one of them too! Which is super attractive ",0,Jill,2018-08-26 22:47:06

"I really like how you seem to have such a strong desire to enjoy the life you have, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to come at the expense of other people being just being NPCs in your experience",0,James,2018-08-26 22:51:39
People like you are rare and the best,0,James,2018-08-26 22:52:22

How do I learn the body waves though? ,0,Jill,2018-08-27 16:40:08
Or body rolls. I have heard both,0,Jill,2018-08-27 16:41:26
I can show you some of the movements as far as I know them. I need to learn how to lead some of these moves too,0,James,2018-08-27 16:43:21
"and I‚Äôve seen different advice for leading it. one guy said it was lead by applying pressure to your partner‚Äôs shoulder blades, one said it was applying pressure to the lower back",0,James,2018-08-27 16:44:30
"They are both right or make sense because logically, body rolls start from the chin then shoulders, so you apply pressure there to signal.",0,Jill,2018-08-27 16:51:05
And then sometimes you provide support to the lower back depending on the moves,0,Jill,2018-08-27 16:51:33
Sometimes you move the hands up to the upper shoulder to provide support,0,Jill,2018-08-27 16:52:02
Basically your hands move as she moves,0,Jill,2018-08-27 16:52:18
That sounds very intuitive to me,0,Jill,2018-08-27 16:52:48

"Watch 1:33-1:50, you will see what I mean",0,Jill,2018-08-27 16:59:27
Height of your partner is obviously a factor too,0,Jill,2018-08-27 17:00:03
"I‚Äôm glad you feel like part of the cue is the support, because my teachers have been telling us not to use the leads for support. I keep feeling like ‚Äúthen what am I doing here‚Äù lol",0,James,2018-08-27 17:02:23
"also, I‚Äôm glad that I seem to have gotten you stuck on watching these bachata videos. there‚Äôs a few I like rewatching and then trying to do",0,James,2018-08-27 17:03:14
I just wish there was a fast class so that 2 classes and im done ü§£,0,Jill,2018-08-27 17:04:10
Want to take a private class with me? Maybe we can just pick a video and be like ‚Äúteach me all these moves‚Äù,0,James,2018-08-27 17:06:33
What classes are you taking now,0,Jill,2018-08-27 17:08:32
Maybe I can start at level 2 or something ,0,Jill,2018-08-27 17:09:59
Then we can take a private lesson. I think that would be the best,0,Jill,2018-08-27 17:14:49
"I‚Äôm taking level 3, but I‚Äôm not entirely sure the levels mean much",0,James,2018-08-27 17:20:13
Probably not a bad idea though ,0,James,2018-08-27 17:20:24
Off to band practice now ,0,James,2018-08-27 17:21:22
Off to rebuilding my lungs and glutes,0,Jill,2018-08-27 17:24:06
Want to come to bachata class with me tomorrow?,0,James,2018-08-28 17:04:48
Or maybe grab a drink in Bellevue?,0,James,2018-08-28 17:05:47
Bachata preferably ,0,Jill,2018-08-28 18:23:28
Are droppings allowed?,0,Jill,2018-08-28 18:23:45
Drop-ins,0,Jill,2018-08-28 18:23:49
"Drop ins yes, I‚Äôm pretty sure droppings would be frowned on.",0,James,2018-08-28 18:38:20

Oh wow üëèüèª,0,Jill,2018-08-28 18:43:01

Yup that would be good,0,Jill,2018-08-28 22:06:43
"Sweet! The class is in belltown. Want to meet at my place, get a lesson and then head over there?",0,James,2018-08-28 22:08:32
Sounds good,0,Jill,2018-08-28 22:09:13
Always takes me a little bit to get in the mood,0,Jill,2018-08-28 22:09:38
"Why do u take the class in belltown, not century?",0,Jill,2018-08-28 22:10:38
Oh it was recommended to me,0,James,2018-08-29 00:49:08
The century instructors focus a lot on choreography ,0,James,2018-08-29 00:49:23
But I wanted to learn how to properly do the whole lead/follow dynamic ,0,James,2018-08-29 00:49:42
Went to century for two months and was not super impressed,0,James,2018-08-29 00:50:09

One of my favorite things to do with you is when we‚Äôre both laying in bed,0,James,2018-09-06 10:34:46
and you‚Äôre lying on your stomach,0,James,2018-09-06 10:33:43
I just love running my fingers from the back of your neck to the small of your back,0,James,2018-09-06 10:35:28
With locking eyes ,0,Jill,2018-09-06 10:37:04
Do you want to do that Friday night?,0,Jill,2018-09-06 10:37:55
"I do, but unfortunately I‚Äôll be starting a three day backpacking trip on the Oregon coast tomorrow morning...",0,James,2018-09-06 10:38:55
"Oh right, I forgot ",0,Jill,2018-09-06 10:39:37
"Think of it this way, more time = more tension",0,James,2018-09-06 10:39:53
Beautifully put,0,Jill,2018-09-06 10:41:03
Now to defuse how turned on by now from fantasizing about you: the guy sitting next to me obviously did not put on any deodorant today,0,James,2018-09-06 10:53:41
That should work! ;),0,Jill,2018-09-06 11:21:07
Im interviewing tomorrow,0,Jill,2018-09-06 14:06:04
How do I tell a story that makes the experience of managing 10s of thousands of smaller partners relevant to managing one big partner,0,Jill,2018-09-06 14:07:10
You could replace the word partner with customer if that helps ,0,Jill,2018-09-06 14:07:40
"Hmmm, maybe something about all the variation in demands that you could expect to see in a single large customer you‚Äôve already experienced in all of your smaller ones.",0,James,2018-09-06 14:17:15
Although I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs as relevant in marketing as it is in engineering,0,James,2018-09-06 14:18:26
"I think that's a good approach, thank you",0,Jill,2018-09-06 14:22:10
yaaaaay I‚Äôm helping,0,James,2018-09-06 14:25:38
is it an internal interview? or are you leaving where you‚Äôre at?,0,James,2018-09-06 14:25:55
I was approached by a different company,0,Jill,2018-09-06 14:27:58
"well good luck with the interview, may the force be with you",0,James,2018-09-06 14:28:35
"don‚Äôt say that though, they‚Äôll think you‚Äôre a nerd",0,James,2018-09-06 14:28:53
A classic is what a classic does,0,Jill,2018-09-06 14:30:08
nice. own it,0,James,2018-09-06 14:30:21
I tend to let myself communicate in an efficient way...sometimes leaving out the details,0,Jill,2018-09-06 14:32:43
Knowing you and listening to you talk have opened up doors for me to go a little deeper sometimes. I do find myself channeling you sometimes,0,Jill,2018-09-06 14:33:59
"In a good, not creepy way ",0,Jill,2018-09-06 14:34:14
"Complementing, like you said I guess",0,Jill,2018-09-06 14:34:58
"Haha, don‚Äôt overdo it though. I really like the way you communicate; everything seems so complete and well put together",0,James,2018-09-06 14:35:11
I feel like sometimes I will start talking even though the thought isn‚Äôt complete,0,James,2018-09-06 14:35:27
"but yeah, some mix of the two of our styles is the most eloquent person on the planet",0,James,2018-09-06 14:35:47
I always find diamonds in what you say even when the thought isn't complete yet,0,Jill,2018-09-06 14:38:52
"diamonds may be pretty, but pearls are classic",0,James,2018-09-06 14:39:50
that was supposed to be a ‚Äúpearls of wisdom‚Äù thing,0,James,2018-09-06 14:40:01
like you do smart talk,0,James,2018-09-06 14:40:07
durr,0,James,2018-09-06 14:40:13
Haha,0,Jill,2018-09-06 14:40:34
I think we've stroked each other's egos well enough for the day ;),0,Jill,2018-09-06 14:41:02
"yeah, it‚Äôs unfortunate we can‚Äôt stroke some other things",0,James,2018-09-06 14:41:29
The best strokes are worth waiting for,0,Jill,2018-09-06 14:42:34
"I think a transient ischemic stroke is the best stroke, because the damage is less likely to be permanent",0,James,2018-09-06 14:44:36
badum tiss,0,James,2018-09-06 14:44:46
Tough one to follow,0,Jill,2018-09-06 14:46:46
Let me leave you with a different thought then,0,Jill,2018-09-06 14:47:53
I was thinking about having you in my mouth and feeling you tense up ,0,Jill,2018-09-06 14:49:59
oh yeah? now I won‚Äôt be able to stop thinking of how hot you look when you‚Äôre going down on me,0,James,2018-09-06 14:52:23
Have a good trip!!,0,Jill,2018-09-06 22:16:56
I‚Äôll be thinking of you on those long nights üòò,0,James,2018-09-06 22:28:44
"Leaving coverage here, good luck on your interview!",0,James,2018-09-07 10:30:43
I actually had a dream about you last night ,0,Jill,2018-09-07 17:38:15
Have you ever done any thesis or research on dreams and thoughts,0,Jill,2018-09-07 17:40:00
ÔøºHey! Lucky me hearing from you! It‚Äôs cold...,1,James,2018-09-07 21:37:16
Haven‚Äôt done any dream reading no.,0,James,2018-09-07 21:37:16
Glad to be in your dreams though,0,James,2018-09-07 21:37:26
It was pouring just now. Glad it looks dry where you are,0,Jill,2018-09-07 22:07:01
Hey! Just got back. You‚Äôll be glad to know that it was pouring pretty frequently the whole trip...,0,James,2018-09-09 22:15:14
I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm wet but that would detract from any future sexy talk,0,James,2018-09-09 22:15:36
"Going to pass out now. Hope your weekend was good, and hope to see you again soon...",0,James,2018-09-09 22:20:15
Im sure you'll sleep really well tonight...wet or dry tell me all about it some time,0,Jill,2018-09-10 00:12:29
"Absolutely, and you can tell me about that dream I‚Äôve been wondering about all weekend üòâ",0,James,2018-09-10 08:34:58
ÔøºFYI most perfect sand dollar ever ,1,James,2018-09-10 09:15:01
Don‚Äôt act like you‚Äôre not impressed,0,James,2018-09-10 09:15:04
Symmetrical ,0,Jill,2018-09-10 12:41:27
"Speaking of which, I took an EQ test yesterday for no reason. I was only 140/200 ü§î",0,Jill,2018-09-10 12:42:32
Now I'm wondering what insensitive things I am saying all the time to people üòÇ,0,Jill,2018-09-10 12:43:25
Probably designed by someone so emotionally aware they could be diagnosed with reverse autism,0,James,2018-09-10 13:00:28
That was insensitive,0,James,2018-09-10 13:00:32
You sound like my grandpa. People he loves are always in the right ;),0,Jill,2018-09-10 13:09:14
We'd have to make you take it too to make the sample size slightly larger,0,Jill,2018-09-10 13:09:53
Send it. I‚Äôll kick it‚Äôs ass,0,James,2018-09-10 13:18:52
"Also, your grandpa sounds cool",0,James,2018-09-10 13:19:00
Well do it together,0,Jill,2018-09-10 13:20:57
We'll ,0,Jill,2018-09-10 13:21:10
üòç,0,James,2018-09-10 13:27:11
"What are you doing Wednesday evening? I‚Äôm trying to figure out an excuse for us to hang out, but I figure I can figure that part out later...",0,James,2018-09-10 21:06:20
"We can hang out, bachata, drink some whiskey, laugh at the EQ test, and talk about hopes and dreams",0,Jill,2018-09-10 21:23:11
And the very wet trip to the end of nowhere,0,Jill,2018-09-10 21:23:41
Suggestions like this are one of the many reasons I like you,0,James,2018-09-10 21:24:56
So. That stuff?,0,James,2018-09-10 21:25:17
Random and small?,0,Jill,2018-09-10 21:25:30
Random and small but indicators of compatible personal and interpersonal styles ,0,James,2018-09-10 21:26:07
Haha,0,Jill,2018-09-10 21:26:40
"Like, it doesn‚Äôt have to be a whole event. Just two neat people being neat",0,James,2018-09-10 21:26:48
Im suspecting that the analysis I put you to is actually happening ,0,Jill,2018-09-10 21:27:27
;),0,Jill,2018-09-10 21:27:32
I‚Äôve actually been trying to find some way to download our texts so I can do some sentiment/topic analysis ,0,James,2018-09-10 21:28:08
Which was part of the reason I‚Äôm so bummed about losing the tinder thread,0,James,2018-09-10 21:28:21
Hide it from me,0,Jill,2018-09-10 21:28:41
Oh right,0,James,2018-09-10 21:28:49
I mean I‚Äôm doing dumb stuff ,0,James,2018-09-10 21:29:01
I dont want me to act in a certain way to skew the results one way or another,0,Jill,2018-09-10 21:29:20
You are a true scientist,0,James,2018-09-10 21:29:35
üë©‚Äçüî¨ ,0,James,2018-09-10 21:29:49
"If you download the app again, am I still going to be there?",0,Jill,2018-09-10 21:30:23
"Im guessing not, because they deleted everything from my feed too",0,Jill,2018-09-10 21:30:43
"...I deleted my account, but now I need to check",0,James,2018-09-10 21:30:46
Then its a definite no,0,Jill,2018-09-10 21:31:18
"Damn, didn‚Äôt work. Was worth a shot",0,James,2018-09-10 21:34:55
What sets you apart is the true positive doer you're. I dont have anybody else like this in my life...I don't think,0,Jill,2018-09-10 21:41:22
Not the fake kind who reads a book from Amazon and starts to think positively...kudos to those people aside,0,Jill,2018-09-10 21:44:21
You're the real deal!!,0,Jill,2018-09-10 21:44:40
Yes all my books are either Star Wars or game of thrones lol.,0,James,2018-09-10 21:46:29
"I know you‚Äôre a bit of a private person, but statements like these make me want to know you even better. You are such an aware person and know exactly how to express your thoughts it‚Äôs just uncanny",0,James,2018-09-10 21:47:50
"And the privacy thing isn‚Äôt a dig, I really am enjoying getting to know you ",0,James,2018-09-10 21:48:49
I think we‚Äôre very similar in the doing life thing though,0,James,2018-09-10 21:50:17
You're handling it exceptionally well!,0,Jill,2018-09-10 21:50:24
It‚Äôs the same vibe I get from you,0,James,2018-09-10 21:50:27
Lol I like that you ‚Äúhandling it.‚Äù I‚Äôm hardly suffering,0,James,2018-09-10 21:51:53
üòò,0,James,2018-09-10 21:52:03
It doesn't take any effort to know what I have known about you so far either,0,Jill,2018-09-10 21:54:42
That didn't come out right,0,Jill,2018-09-10 22:00:43
Its been effortless...is what I'm trying to say,0,Jill,2018-09-10 22:00:56
"Nah, it sounded perfect ",0,James,2018-09-10 22:00:56
"Right? It really has been. Gonna be honest, I feel like there have been times where things have felt forced. Never been the case here",0,James,2018-09-10 22:02:22
That sounded weird too,0,James,2018-09-10 22:03:36
Me like you.,0,James,2018-09-10 22:03:41
Inc the hike,0,Jill,2018-09-10 22:03:52
So effortless ;),0,Jill,2018-09-10 22:03:56
Want to get dinner tonight? I feel like whenever we get together we focus on one hunger but not the other üòú,0,James,2018-09-12 11:30:16
This barbarian talk is much needed! Lets do it,0,Jill,2018-09-12 12:15:53
Then let us drive our enemies before us and feast on their harvests,0,James,2018-09-12 12:16:41
Or like japanese food or something,0,James,2018-09-12 12:16:37
That sounds light enough = sounds good!,0,Jill,2018-09-12 12:17:37
I‚Äôll find some place that serves drinks in skulls,0,James,2018-09-12 12:17:55
"Speaking of which, I just finished last epi of westworld ",0,Jill,2018-09-12 12:17:55
Honestly not enough blood or sex,0,Jill,2018-09-12 12:18:02
Last epi of season 1,0,Jill,2018-09-12 12:18:27
"actually, now that I think of it",0,James,2018-09-12 12:19:40
most of the murder fucking was done by the madame,0,James,2018-09-12 12:19:38
And she jumps off the train last minute because of the kid who is not hers... talking about being anti climactic ,0,Jill,2018-09-12 12:21:31
And her nipples are weird...like rubbery nude,0,Jill,2018-09-12 12:22:04
lol,0,James,2018-09-12 12:22:13
Didn't work for me,0,Jill,2018-09-12 12:22:16
That is the best description of nipples I have ever seen,0,James,2018-09-12 12:22:21
but it‚Äôs like a statement about the emotional pull our perception of reality has on us right?,0,James,2018-09-12 12:23:49
like these things which may be trivial or even inventions of our own minds still compel us to do crazy shit,0,James,2018-09-12 12:24:21
and have rubbery nipples,0,James,2018-09-12 12:24:24
damn if I wasn‚Äôt at work I‚Äôd be googling ‚Äúwestworld madame nipples‚Äù right now,0,James,2018-09-12 12:24:59
Haha,0,Jill,2018-09-12 12:25:11
And too large too,0,Jill,2018-09-12 12:25:15
Like 50% of the boobs are covered by nipples,0,Jill,2018-09-12 12:25:38
oh my god,0,James,2018-09-12 12:25:49
A percentage of me may be robotic then,0,Jill,2018-09-12 12:26:26
Her analytical and cold blooded side resonated with me more üòÇ,0,Jill,2018-09-12 12:26:47
yeah I could see that,0,James,2018-09-12 12:27:26
like you seem like you have some sort of cost/benefit analysis going on,0,James,2018-09-12 12:29:04
Her last move didn't make sense,0,Jill,2018-09-12 12:29:56
which when you think about reinforcement learning in machine learning,0,James,2018-09-12 12:30:02
is absolutely how a machine would think,0,James,2018-09-12 12:30:09
"She should have gotten out, become stronger and come back in to get her daughter out",0,Jill,2018-09-12 12:30:15
Oh I don't get what you're saying,0,Jill,2018-09-12 12:30:46
But that sounds hot,0,Jill,2018-09-12 12:30:52
I want to stick my student meta learner on your neural network,0,James,2018-09-12 12:31:33
rawr,0,James,2018-09-12 12:31:35
"yeah, you‚Äôd think after becoming aware of her cycle of suffering",0,James,2018-09-12 12:32:10
she‚Äôd be able to justify delaying any action for a while longer,0,James,2018-09-12 12:32:34
or maybe it‚Äôs that staying inside allows her to operate in an environment she actually understands,0,James,2018-09-12 12:32:54
because the outside world would be foreign to her,0,James,2018-09-12 12:32:56
I don‚Äôt know. I heard there were samurai in the second season so who knows,0,James,2018-09-12 12:33:08
Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. ,0,Jill,2018-09-12 12:33:47
Wow your stuff is hot,0,Jill,2018-09-12 12:33:52
your use of a reinforcement learning scheme in a complex biological computer is hot,0,James,2018-09-12 12:35:18
That what we've been doing?,0,Jill,2018-09-12 12:36:05
I was going to say no because there‚Äôs something unquantifiable going on here which is difficult for machines to understand,0,James,2018-09-12 12:37:10
"but in the absence of data, evaluating the rewards/penalties of certain actions is a pretty solid way to know if something is good",0,James,2018-09-12 12:37:43
"but yeah, I‚Äôd say we‚Äôre learning",0,James,2018-09-12 12:38:00
"Haha data scientist, Im lost ",0,Jill,2018-09-12 12:38:11
"We haven't seen each other in a while, was that delayed gratification ",0,Jill,2018-09-12 12:38:42
Hows that for human language üòÇ,0,Jill,2018-09-12 12:38:51
excellent. beep boop,0,James,2018-09-12 12:39:19
thinking of you is enough to get me through the delay üòâ,0,James,2018-09-12 12:41:06
"Can you explain this whole thread to me tonight, and just nerd all the way out",0,Jill,2018-09-12 12:43:05
I‚Äôll steal some more dry erase markers from the office,0,James,2018-09-12 12:43:39
You know I really want to say something meaningful right now,0,Jill,2018-09-12 12:44:18
But all I can squeeze out is; expect some hard sucking after,0,Jill,2018-09-12 12:45:26
Oh boy ,0,Jill,2018-09-12 12:45:29
"I couldn‚Äôt think of a good response to this, so I just audibly snorted and caught a weird look from the guy across from me",0,James,2018-09-12 12:47:21

Want to go to Adana?,0,James,2018-09-12 16:39:49

Yup! Also on your list of spots üòâ,0,James,2018-09-12 17:07:39

Not sure anymore. Initially was the poor business practices,0,James,2018-09-12 19:23:45
But now it‚Äôs just the default button I press ,0,James,2018-09-12 19:23:57
